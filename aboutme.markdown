<h2>About Me</h2>

I am currently at Genpact Digital leading an ML Platform team that is developing an MLOps platform. I previously held managerial roles in data sciences and data engineering organizations at Truecaller and [24]7.ai. I started my career as a research scientist at General Motors R&D, and also had couple of stints with Hewlett Packard and Marketics (now WNS) as an analytics professional.

I have a Ph.D. from University of Notre Dame in Mechanical Engineering. My thesis was in the field on reliability-based optimization for multidisciplinary systems. I obtained my bachelors from Indian Institue of Technology, Madras (Chennai) in Mechanical Engineering.

I have published [1 book][booklink] and [15 papers][dhanesh-rg] in journals and conference proceedings. I have one patent pending on predictive model development - [US20170185904A1â€‹][patent-link]. 

In tech, I am quite excited about Kubernetes as we use it quite heavily at work. I have worked on big data applications for several years in Hive, Spark and Vertica. I code in Python predominantly these days. I dabble in [Kaggle][kaggle-link] competitions from time to time.
